This is a repository of most of the CS work I've performed in school thus far. 
- Kattis Folder contains C# programs which deal with implementing and changing Data Algorithms to solve unique problems.
- C++_Work contains the c++ code I've written in various classes at the U.
- Security contains code I've written that places a focus on learning Hacking/Secrity protocols.
- Databases contains code which utilizes LINQ within C# to call from databases that were provided by my classes.
- Random_Code holds a list of little projects that I've done on the side for fun or to test something.
